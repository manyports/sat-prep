This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction \"and\" to join the rst main clause (\"In 1919 Larrazolo was elected governor of New Mexico\") and the second main clause (\"in 1928 he became the nation’s rst Hispanic US Senator\"). Choice A is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’s conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can’t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.
